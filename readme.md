# Text adventure but different

This text adventure uses a different organization style. Instead of many if / elif / else statements, there is a list, saving data. There are indeed if / elif statements to check whether something is saved. For example whether the character walked right or left.


I saw many text adventures but they all used this confusing style. This style saves time and space. There are methods to write text and to ask a question.

This text adventure is just a short demo to try this style out. I got the idea really spontaneous, and wanted to try it out...
It's kinda about a horror scenario... but not really spooky.
